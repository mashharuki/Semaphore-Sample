# ToasterProvider Test Specification

## Requirements
1. ToasterProvider should be a client component ('use client')
2. ToasterProvider should accept children prop
3. ToasterProvider should render the Toaster component from react-hot-toast
4. ToasterProvider should render children inside the provider
5. Toaster should have appropriate positioning and styling

## Manual Test Cases

### Test 1: Component Renders
- [ ] ToasterProvider renders without errors
- [ ] Children are rendered correctly

### Test 2: Toaster Configuration
- [ ] Toaster component is included in the render tree
- [ ] Toaster has appropriate position (default: top-center or bottom-center)
- [ ] Toaster styling matches the app theme (dark mode if applicable)

### Test 3: Integration with Layout
- [ ] ToasterProvider can be imported in layout.tsx
- [ ] No TypeScript errors when integrated
- [ ] Application starts without errors

## Expected Behavior
When a toast is triggered (e.g., `toast.success("Message")`), it should:
- Display at the configured position
- Match the app's theme
- Auto-dismiss after a reasonable time
- Be accessible and readable
